			<p>You know what people call Cowboys these daysm it's freelancers like us. Our kind is respected in the outer system but if you're planning on chaasing bounties in the inner belt, get used to hear "Cowboy" uttered with a good dose of comtempt.<br>
within the Network, we tend to refer to each other as "Aces" of a suit that fit our specialties.</p>
